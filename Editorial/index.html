											<p>A complete forum of all Joker related information.</p>
										</header>
										<p>The Joker is a supervillain created by Bill Finger, Bob Kane, and Jerry Robinson who first appeared in the debut issue of the comic book Batman (April 25, 1940), published by DC Comics. Credit for the Joker's creation is disputed; Kane and Robinson claimed responsibility for the Joker's design while acknowledging Finger's writing contribution. Although the Joker was planned to be killed off during his initial appearance, he was spared by editorial intervention, allowing the character to endure as the archenemy of the superhero Batman.</p>

												<h3>Jaoquin Phoenix</h3>
												<p>The very fact that a Joker film exists is proof that this classic comic book villain has grown far beyond his origin as an eccentric antagonist to Batman and became a cultural icon — the clown-faced ambassador of madness. No actor stepping into the role can take the job lightly, and arguably that goes double for Joaquin Phoenix in Joker, because he has no Batman to square off against. Phoenix had to create a compelling character who would keep our attention without jackets full of lethal toys and fights in bell towers. According to what the critics have to say so far, he's succeeded.</p>

												<h3>Heath Ledger</h3>
												<p>In order to transform into his own unique version of the Joker, Ledger pushed himself physically and mentally further than he ever had for a role. From isolating himself for over a month to becoming heavily involved with makeup and wardrobe decisions for the character, Ledger put in every effort to set his performance apart from his predecessors. This extreme effort took a toll on the actor, leaving him exhausted and sleep deprived.</p>

												<h3>Jack Nicholson</h3>
												<p>No one who was on the set will ever forget the day the Joker freaked out. With his face frozen in grotesque makeup, he suddenly started screaming that his deal was fraudulent, his director was unprepared, his dialogue was stilted and he was quitting the doomed show. He kept shouting expletives for over two hours to anyone who would listen, then marched off the set.</p>

												<h3>Caesor Ramaero</h3>
												<p>Romero played the Joker in the 1960s campy Batman live-action series. His performance was an exercise in nefarious good-natured glee. Though the Joker in the comic books is often presented as mentally ill or criminally insane, Romero's white-faced arch-nemesis always had his wits about him. It was Frank Gorshin, the Riddler on the series, who played his masked villain with barely restrained manic intensity, giggling, staring, emotionally volatile, and on the verge of a complete mental break.</p>

											<h3>Dear Joker,<br> Why so seriously out of character?</h3>
											<p>The Joker of the DC Universe is an archetype of pure unadulterated evil with no purpose except to terrorise. By humanising the character, Todd Philips may well have boosted the cause of mental healthcare, but has utterly diluted the Real Joker.</p>
